                                  put out listings for items they are looking for and
                                  sellers can offer them a price if they have the item
                                  for the buyer. This was the final project for
                                  my Database Design course using to organize
                                  all the data in the marketplace between users,
                                  listings, offers, user ratings, and hashtags. I
                                  decided to write this app in Ruby on Rails to
                                  improve my Rails skills, as well as my overall
                                  skill as a full stack engineer.`;

export const hypecookerContent = `Hypecooker is a bot for the popular clothing
                                  retailer, Supreme. New items from Supreme drop
                                  every Thursday morning and sell out within
                                  seconds because of other bots. Those items then
                                  resell for a hefty premium on secondary markets.
                                  I combined my experience from being a QA engineer
                                  at Jobcase and my love of streetwear and
                                  used Selenium to write this open source bot
                                  to automate the checkout process for buyers that
                                  want to buy items without going through resellers.
                                  This Java app has a UI for users to specify which
                                  items they want to add to their cart and enter in
                                  their checkout information. Users may add multiple
                                  items to their carts. Once the user hits the button
                                  to start the automation, the script will go to each
                                  item, add the item to the cart, and check out as soon
                                  as possible.`
