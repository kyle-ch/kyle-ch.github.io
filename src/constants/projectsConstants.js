export const hypecookerContent = `Hypecooker is a bot for the popular clothing

                                  every Thursday morning and sell out within
                                  seconds because of other bots. Those items then
                                  resell for a hefty premium on secondary markets.
                                  I combined my experience from being a QA engineer
                                  at Jobcase and my love of streetwear and
                                  used Selenium to write this open source bot
                                  to automate the checkout process for buyers that
                                  want to buy items without going through resellers.
                                  This Java app has a UI for users to specify which
                                  items they want to add to their cart and enter in
                                  their checkout information. Users may add multiple
                                  items to their carts. Once the user hits the button
                                  to start the automation, the script will go to each
                                  item, add the item to the cart, and check out as soon
                                  as possible.`

export const collabContent = `Collab is a personal project I did to learn Ruby

                              uses a gem that wraps the Spotify API. Collab allows users
                              to search for 2 of their favorite artists and then searches
                              their songs on Spotify and makes a list of songs that they
                              have appeared on collaboratively. The user then has the ability
                              to click a button to login and have a playlist with that list of
                              songs on their Spotify Though it looks very crude, I was very
                              proud of this project because I learned a great deal throughout
                              the development process. It was my first Ruby on Rails from start
                              to finish and I was very excited to show it off to others to showcase
                              my love for music and my growth as a developer.`
