                          turns it upside down by empowering buyers. Buyers
                          put out listings for items they are looking for and
                          sellers can offer them a price if they have the item
                          for the buyer.\n This was the final project for
                          my Database Design course using mySQL to organize
                          all the data in the marketplace between users,
                          listings, offers, user ratings, and hashtags. I
                          decided to write this app in Ruby on Rails to
                          improve my Rails skills, as well as my overall
                          skill as a full stack engineer.`;
